🔨 ForgeBuild
ForgeBuild is a C++ build system written in Python.
It’s currently in early development — contributions are welcome!

🧠 Why ForgeBuild?
CMake wasn’t kind to my neurodiverse brain.
It felt verbose, frustrating, and hard to reason about.
So I built something better — something that makes sense to me, and hopefully to you too.

🔧 Supported Compilers
ForgeBuild currently supports:
- clang++
- (G++ was removed in 5.0.)

🚀 Installation Instructions
- Clone this repo:
gh repo clone glkdrlgkrlzflnjkgh/ForgeBuild
- Run the init command from the folder where you want your project:
py C:/path/to/forgebuild.py --init
- (Use python instead of py if needed.)
- Congrats! You’ve set up a ForgeBuild project!

# Why?

to put it simply. CMake was not the nicest... to my neurodiverse brain (it was frustrating and actually, quite verbose...)
and yes. that's why I made ForgeBuild.




### üîß Supported Compilers
ForgeBuild currently supports the following C++ compilers:
- `clang++`
- `g++`

More compiler support may be added in future releases.

3. congrats! you have setup a ForgeBuild project!

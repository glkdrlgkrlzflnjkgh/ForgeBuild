🔨 ForgeBuild
ForgeBuild is a C++ build system written in Python.
It’s currently in early development — contributions are welcome!

🧠 Why ForgeBuild?
CMake wasn’t kind to my neurodiverse brain.
It felt verbose, frustrating, and hard to reason about.
So I built something better — something that makes sense to me, and hopefully to you too.

🔧 Supported Compilers
ForgeBuild currently supports:
- clang++
- g++
More compiler support may be added in future releases.
